# Getting started

**Note: we are in close beta â€” some APIs WILL change**

First of all, you need to install Github CodeChecks app on repositories that you're interested using
with CC.

1. Log into our [web application](https://app.codechecks.io/) using Github.
2. Click "Add new project" button
3. You will be redirected back into Github interface where you need to select appropriate
   repositories.
4. Once done you should be able to see all repositories within our app (if not please refresh). Note
   that in the right top corner you can switch between orgs.
5. Copy secret using "copy" button and paste it as secret environment inside your CI interface:

```
CC_SECRET=COPIED SECRET
```

For now only CircleCI is supported.

In this mini tutorial we assume that you develop frontend app so we want to watch how build size is
changing between PRs. We can use already existing codecheck:
https://github.com/codechecks/build-size-watcher

Let's start with installing deps:

```sh
yarn add --dev @codechecks/client @codechecks/build-size-watcher
```

Now, let's create `codechecks.json` file which allows to declaratively configure multiple checks.
Note that there are also other ways to use codechecks, for example you can create codechecks.ts (or
js) file and execute arbitrary code (including other codechecks) and access API directly.

`codechecks.json`:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "build-size-watcher",
      "options": {
        "gzip": false,
        "files": [
          { "path": "./build/static/js/*.js" },
          { "path": "./build/static/css/*.css" },
          { "path": "./build/static/images/*" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We specify that we want to track JS, CSS and images. Note that by using wildcards we track correctly
files with hashes. You might want to tweaks these paths depending on your file structure.

We are almost done, last thing is to actually run codechecks as part of your CI pipeline. So far we
support only CircleCI (travis support is coming soon). Important bit here is that you need to build
app before running codehecks (so we can measure it's size). You can see sample here:
https://github.com/OasisDEX/eth2dai/blob/4bc1606dfbe0f002261b24fefc0a5c47c0cd950c/.circleci/config.yml#L72
To run codehecks simple do `yarn codechecks`.

Make sure to add `CC_SECRET` environment variable to your CI secrets. That's it! Push your changes,
create PR and see how we measure build size. Remeber, this is one of the simplest codechecks,
imagine all the possibilities! ðŸ”¥
