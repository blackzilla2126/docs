# codechecks.io — Documentation

Open source platform for code review automation.

With Codechecks you can replace tools like:
- [BundleWatch](https://bundlewatch.io/#/)
- [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/)

and build even more cool stuff:
- visual regression 
- type coverage checking for typescript projects
- deployments per commits 
- performance tracking

[Check out what's already build](https://github.com/codechecks)

Best part: everything is open source and checks run in userland (your CI) meaning you can implement totally new ideas without any backend changes — it's just JavaScript. API component is general enough to fit lots of different use cases.

**We are in closed beta**
